        <p>
            Hello there! My name is Jackson Jewell, and this is my portfolio. I was born on August 21st 1998, 
            and am currently working as an Engineering Technician at Hankook Tire in Clarksville Tennessee. Professionally
            I'm interesting in coding and software  development, as I love computers and have a passion for building things.
        </p>
        <p>
            Outside of work or school I'm a massive nerd, particularly when it comes to fantasy, science fiction, and writing. 
            I have several major ongoing fantasy writing projects, the foremost  of which is the development of my own world,
            Caracklyst. I also have a novel in the works set in my world, and if you'd ever like to chat about it I'll talk
            your ears off. In addition to this I'm an avid tabletop gamer. I primarily play Warhammer 40,000 and 
            Dungeons & Dragons.
        </p>

            I'll likely update this site with lots of cool stuff over the next few months, so be sure to check back in soon!
